Thanks to John Walker for midicsv - a utility to convert midi files into csv files.
This is in the public domain, and honestly why would you do anything with it...

In order to use this software, install the midicsv tool (untar and read its README) and ensure your pcspkr is enabled (may have to 'sudo modprobe pcspkr').
